# Assignment5
## . 1) Implement Na√Øve Bayes method using scikit-learn library
     
# Load glass dataset
glass_data = pd.read_csv("glass.csv")

# Split the dataset into features and target
X = glass_data.iloc[:, :-1]
y = glass_data.iloc[:, -1]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a Gaussian Naive Bayes model
model = GaussianNB()

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model on the test data
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))




### 2)Implement linear SVM method using scikit library
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

# Load the glass dataset
glass = datasets.load_glass()
X = glass.data
y = glass.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model using linear SVM
clf = svm.LinearSVC()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model using accuracy score and classification report
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

### The accuracy of the model depends on the specific data, modal parameters, and other factors. It's not possible to determine which algorithm will have better accuracy without evaluating it on the specific data. To justify the choice of algoritm, one would need to compare the accuracy, recall, and other metrics for each algorithm and select the one that perfoems best.
